# .dotfiles
### Install Script: Installs all necessary tools to create a dev environment on any linux instance 
- Uses stow to symlink necessary files to home dir

### Usage:
- cd into .dotfiles dir
- ./dotfiles

### TODO: 
- Add differentiation in steps between Mac/Linux/WSL2 (mainly for homebrew)
- automate git and git CLI setup, as much as possible

### Issues: 
- script completes on oh-my-zsh install
- every step after needs to be manually completed
